# Crust Rush handover: read this first every session

Purpose: a running record of what broke, why, and what fixed it, so a fix made several updates ago is not undone by
accident and so old fixes can be reused. Add an entry whenever a bug is fixed. Newest entries first. Keep entries short:
**what broke / why / fix / how to keep it fixed**.

## Where things are
- Web game: one source file `crust-rush.html`, built into the app repo (branch `main`). PC: Godot, branch `godot`.
  The PC's track files are exported by CI from the *published* web game, so web goes out first, then the export, then PC.
- Both must agree on anything that moves a kart (online play is deterministic). Bump the online version on both
  (`NET_PROTO` on web, `PROTO` in `scripts/webnet.gd`) whenever kart physics, track data or race messages change.
- Miniature Mayhem (toy tracks) working notes: `/home/claude/mini/PLAN.md`. PC notes: project docs
  `crust-rush-pc-build-notes*.md`. Rendering notes: `crust-rush-rendering-notes.md`.

## Standing rules (from the user)
- Commit and push every update. Keep the CC-BY waterfall credit (PC README and `assets/hd/waterfall/credits.txt`).
- Never change the user's uploaded kart designs. No non-BMP characters in the web source.
- Nothing that risks online play. Never ask for or use the TURN secret key.
- Assets: the user's own uploads, original designs, CC0. No copyrighted names or logos (the toy tracks are
  "inspired by" toy racing sets; never use a real brand's name, logo or box art).
- Another session also pushes to both branches: fetch and check ancestry before every push.

## Fix log

### 2026-11-12 night (web source for v155, from the PC session; not yet published, PC not yet done)
| What broke | Why | Fix | Keep it fixed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dropped traps (olive slicks, oil, forks, pizza boxes, fire) lay out of sight under raised road and still hit karts driving above them (Bedroom Blitz spiral, desk and climb; any multi-level track) | They were drawn at floor height (`groundAt`) with no allowance for the raised road; the hit test only compares positions on the map | `hazEy(h)` (engine patch 6) works out the road height once, from the level the owner was on, and tilts the trap to the slope; the draw loop adds it. Hit test unchanged, so online play is unaffected; guests get the height through the mesh record | Anything placed on the road at run time must add the road height (`kEy`) on multi-level tracks. Still open: the hit test has no height check, so a trap on an upper level can catch a kart directly beneath it. Fixing that changes race results: do it on web and PC together with a version bump |
| A stack of books stuck up through the start of the climb on Bedroom Blitz | Its position came from a straight-line guess at the climb's height; the real road eases in and is lower there | The stack is placed from the track's real height (lowest point that clears it, then 48 units further up); that pier's posts stand close in, on the books | Place anything under a raised road from `track[j].ey`, never from a formula; photograph it from the side |
| The side monitor's screen went through the curtain and into the wall | Angled screen placed too close to the wall | Moved forward to y=748 | After placing props, look along every wall for things passing through it |
| Raised track edges kept a dull, speckled finish after the track was made glossy | `TM.mat` caches materials by name and the spare track piece in models.js defined `toyorange` first with the old settings; separately, merged scenery swapped the rails' material for a plain batch material | Both definitions made identical; rail meshes marked `noMerge`; track plastics marked `noHQ` | One definition per material name; a mesh that needs its own material must be `noMerge` |

### 2026-11-12 (web v153 and v154, PC build b2abf99)
| What broke | Why | Fix | Keep it fixed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Karts sank through the road at fixed spots and respawned under it in a loop (Bedroom Blitz desk; could hit any neon or arena track) | Pool hazards (`PONDS`) were only cleared in `planPonds`, which arena/neon/toy maps never reached, so pools from the *previous* track stayed active at their old coordinates | `makeHills` now calls `planPonds(def)` on the arena branch too | Any per-track state must be reset on *every* map type. When adding a map type that returns early from a builder, check what the skipped code resets |
| Kart wobbled, bounced and sat sunk in the road on the tight spiral | `kEy` (road height under a kart) projected the kart onto straight segments between track points; on a tight bend the segments overlap on the inside and leave gaps on the outside, so the height stepped at every point | On toy tracks the height is worked out along the bend (curvature-corrected distance from the nearest point): web `kEy` (TOYT branch), PC `TrackData.k_ey` (toy branch) | Same formula on web and PC. Spirals: radius 150 or more, slope about 0.2 |
| Camera too low on descents: the road behind filled the view | The chase camera sat a fixed height above the kart's own road height; on a slope the road behind is higher | Toy tracks: camera rises by the height of the road behind and looks along the slope ahead (web `cSA`, PC `cam_sb`/`cam_sa`) | Check the chase camera with `neon/chase.py` on every new slope, not only free-camera photos |
| PC only: camera sat far below the kart on every raised road (found while porting) | PC `_camera` used the terrain height without the raised deck (`rg`), web adds `kEy` | `rg = T.ground + T.k_ey` when the track is multi-level | Port camera code line by line; test the PC chase camera on a raised road |
| Leaves poked through the track | Plants placed under or beside raised track without checking their spread | Plants and book stacks moved clear | After placing props, take a top-down photo of every stretch; nothing within the rails, nothing under a low deck |
| Shortcut had gaps in its walls; a booster housing blocked its exit | Rails were dropped within a fixed distance of the junction; housings were placed before shortcuts existed | Rails are now clipped exactly where they cross the other lane (`toyRailClip`), housings are built last and skipped within 40 units of a shortcut | Junctions: both rails must meet; build decorations that depend on shortcuts after `neonShortcuts` |
| Track on the desk was invisible (only the rails showed) | The road was drawn at exactly the desk-top height and the desk top is slightly higher | Desk sections run 2 units above the desk (h=262) | Any road on furniture: 2 units above the surface |
| Toy track too hard to drive at 19 cm wide | Narrowed on request, then found too tight with tight bends and many boosters | Back to the first width (rw=31), bends at least radius 100, spiral radius 150, fewer boosters, steering 30% quicker on toy tracks (`TURN`, exported to PC) | Road width, bend radius and booster count are tuned together; test by driving, not only AI races |
| Orange track looked washed out from above (web) and pale on PC | Sky reflections on glossy plastic indoors | Web: low `envMapIntensity` and clearcoat on the track; PC: `HdToy` turns the mirror strength down on indoor materials | Indoor materials must not mirror the outdoor sky |
| PC only: orange track turned pale yellow in direct sun | The PC's sun is about twice as strong as the web's on this bright, saturated plastic and the tone curve bleaches it | Toy tracks: sun x0.5, room fill x1.25 (`main.gd`), no vivid-look changes | Compare PC and web pictures of the same view after any lighting change |
| Rug hid the track | Rug is 4 units thick; road is drawn at floor level | Rug moved clear of the track; things standing on the rug are lifted by its thickness | No floor covering under a track unless the road is raised above it |
| `gh run download` fails here | Artifact storage host is blocked from this sandbox | CI job `shotspub.yml` zips a run's artifacts onto a scratch pre-release (`shots-tmp`), fetched with `gh api ... releases/assets/<id>` | Use that route for any CI artifact |

### Earlier (kept from previous sessions)
| What broke | Why | Fix | Keep it fixed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Photo rig never produced frames | The game does not draw in state `paused` | Hold the race with `state='countdown'; cd=1e9` | Never pause to take pictures |
| Two heavy renders at once killed the job (exit 137) | Out of memory | One swiftshader browser or one local Godot render at a time | Same rule in CI: at most 8 photo jobs so the PC build is not starved |
| Game would not boot after adding toy code | `cm` and `can` clashed with existing names | Renamed (`tcm`, `sodacan`); `webtest.sh` syntax-checks, `boottest.py` checks the menu comes up | Run both after every source edit; models must not share a name with a helper exported from `TM` |
| Neon shoulders drew orange | A non-arena `else` branch also ran for neon maps | `else if(!def.neon)` | New map types: check every `else` that assumed "normal track" |
| A release was stamped with the old version | Build script run with the previous stamp | Version lives in `neon/webtest.sh`; bump it straight after publishing | Check `sw.js` for the version before committing |
| Fire blew out to white (PC) | Additive blending | Premultiplied alpha at half strength | |

## How to test before publishing
1. `neon/webtest.sh` (syntax check + build), `neon/boottest.py`, `neon/loadtest.py <track>`.
2. `neon/simtest.py <track> medium 230` and `reverse`: all 8 finish, 0 respawns, 0 stuck.
3. `neon/chase.py` (the game's own camera round the lap) and `neon/shots.py` (free camera) for looks.
4. One regular track as a regression (`simtest.py margherita medium 200`).
5. PC: export from CI, `tests/tmp_neon` (AI race), `tests/tmp_cam` (pictures), then push.

### 2026-11-12 (move to the Windows PC)
| What broke | Why | Fix | Keep it fixed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Risk: a build on Windows would change every published file | Git for Windows converts line endings on checkout (`core.autocrlf=true`), and the build hashes file contents | `core.autocrlf false` in the repo, files checked out again, `.gitattributes` with `* -text` on `source`; a fresh build then differs from `main` only in the version stamp | After cloning anywhere new, set this before the first build and check `git status` in `app` after building |
| Risk: `inject_mini.py` and the patch scripts would rewrite the whole source with Windows line endings | They opened the source in text mode; on Windows Python turns every line ending into CRLF on write | `inject_mini.py` and `patch4.py` open files with `newline=''` | Any script that writes `crust-rush.html` or the files in `tools/mini` must pass `newline=''`; check `git diff --stat` shows only the lines you meant to change |
| Scripts could not run on Windows | Cloud-workspace paths, a bash build script, the software renderer flag | `tools\port_paths.py` rewrote the paths to `D:\crust-rush`, `webtest.py` replaces `webtest.sh`, `py.cmd` sets UTF-8 and the browser path | Run scripts through `py.cmd`; plain `python` reads files as cp1252 and can corrupt the source |
